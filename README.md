The Password Generator is incomplete There is currently missing features such as;

- Password and services won't be linked
- Sync with devices to retrieve Password Locally
- UI/Text Isn't currently Scalable
- exe only generated for window ATM,
  can be generated for MAC & Linux
  just haven't done it.

Done Using Godot version 3.5 which is a game engine.

Also Personally I think GODOT can be more than a game engine with the stuff it provides.
